# Critical Path Analysis - Competitive Analysis Tool

## Project Phases & Dependencies

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
```
Streamlit Setup → URL Discovery → Basic Scraping
     ↓              ↓             ↓
   (2-3 days)    (3-4 days)   (2-3 days)
```

**Critical Path:** Sequential - each depends on previous
**Parallel Opportunities:** None in this phase

---

### Phase 2: Social Aggregation (Weeks 3-4)
```
Google Search Queries → Social Scraping → Complaint Categorization
        ↓                    ↓                    ↓
    (2-3 days)           (4-5 days)           (2-3 days)
```

**Critical Path:** Sequential - social scraping needs search queries, categorization needs scraped data
**Parallel Opportunities:** 
- Design complaint categories while building scraping
- Set up database schema in parallel

---

### Phase 3: LLM Analysis (Weeks 5-6)
```
Master Prompt Design → Pricing Analysis → Monetization Analysis → Vision Analysis
        ↓                    ↓                    ↓                    ↓
    (2-3 days)           (3-4 days)           (2-3 days)           (2-3 days)
```

**Critical Path:** Master prompt must be completed first
**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Pricing, Monetization, and Vision analysis can be developed in parallel after prompt is ready
- **Recommended:** Start with pricing analysis, then parallelize monetization and vision

---

### Phase 4: Report Generation (Weeks 7-8)
```
Multi-Tab Interface → Export Functionality
        ↓                    ↓
    (3-4 days)           (2-3 days)
        ↓                    ↓
    Output Sections ←────────┘
        ↓
    (3-4 days)
```

**Critical Path:** Interface → Output Sections
**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Export functionality can be developed in parallel with output sections
- Different output sections can be built simultaneously

---

### Phase 5: Sales & Marketing (Weeks 9-10)
```
Battlecard Generation → Marketing Strategy → SEO Recommendations
        ↓                    ↓                    ↓
    (3-4 days)           (2-3 days)           (2-3 days)
```

**Critical Path:** Can be largely parallelized
**Parallel Opportunities:**
- All three components can be developed simultaneously
- Marketing strategy and SEO recommendations are independent

---

### Phase 6: Testing & Refinement (Weeks 11-12)
```
Comprehensive Testing → System Refinement
        ↓                    ↓
    (4-5 days)           (2-3 days)
```

**Critical Path:** Sequential - refinement depends on testing results
**Parallel Opportunities:** None - testing must be completed before refinement

## Milestone Schedule

| Week | Milestone | Deliverables |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 2 | **Foundation Complete** | Working Streamlit app with basic scraping |
| 4 | **Data Collection Ready** | Social media complaint aggregation working |
| 6 | **AI Analysis Engine Ready** | LLM-powered analysis of all data sources |
| 8 | **MVP Release** | Complete report generation with basic UI |
| 10 | **Full Feature Set** | Sales/marketing recommendations included |
| 12 | **Production Ready** | Tested, optimized, and deployment-ready |

## Critical Path Timeline

**Total Project Duration:** 12 weeks
**Critical Path Duration:** 12 weeks (no time savings possible)
**Parallel Work Opportunities:** Weeks 5-6 and 9-10 offer the most parallelization potential

## Resource Optimization

### Single Developer Path:
- Follow sequential order as outlined
- Focus on one task at a time
- Estimated: 12 weeks

### Two Developer Path:
- **Week 5-6:** Split LLM analysis tasks (Developer 1: Pricing, Developer 2: Monetization + Vision)
- **Week 7-8:** Split UI tasks (Developer 1: Interface, Developer 2: Export + Output Sections)
- **Week 9-10:** Split recommendations (Developer 1: Battlecards, Developer 2: Marketing + SEO)
- **Time Savings:** 2-3 weeks potentially

### Risk Mitigation Priority:
1. **Week 3-4:** Social media scraping (highest technical risk)
2. **Week 5-6:** LLM prompt engineering (highest business risk)
3. **Week 7-8:** Report generation (highest user experience risk)

## Key Dependencies

### External Dependencies:
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API:** Required from Week 3 onwards
- **Google Search API:** Required for Week 3
- **Social Media APIs:** Optional but recommended for Week 4

### Internal Dependencies:
- **StoreHub Context:** Must be provided before Week 5 (LLM analysis)
- **UI/UX Requirements:** Must be defined before Week 7
- **Export Format Requirements:** Must be specified before Week 8
