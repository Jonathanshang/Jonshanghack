# Competitive Analysis Tool - StoreHub

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a **strategic analysis tool** that generates deep-dive, comparative reports on competitors versus StoreHub. From a single URL, the engine discovers and analyzes a competitor's entire commercial strategy—including granular hardware/software pricing, core monetization model, and forward-looking vision. The system systematically scans social media channels and review sites to inject real-world customer complaints and weaknesses into actionable reports.

**Goal:** Create a powerful, on-demand engine that delivers C-level strategic briefs, equipping product, sales, and marketing teams with a decisive information advantage.
